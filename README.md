<h2 class="table">#1- Modding</h2>
<hr/ size= 20px>
<p class="sans-serif">
When putting mods in your equipment, it is preferable to have a few moderate to high rank mods than to fill out every slot with unranked mods. <br/>This is because mods become more useful per mod capacity used as they rank up. <br/><br/><big> For example, </big> at rank 0, Cryo Rounds costs 6 capacity and grants a 15% boost to base damage, offering 2.5% damage per capacity. At max rank, Cryo Rounds costs 11 capacity and provides a 90% boost to base damage for an increase of 8.18%. Because of this, it is generally better at low levels to put Serration and two 90% elementals on your weapon than to try to fill up every slot with unranked mods.
 </p>                            
 <hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Frame Roles<</ins></h3>
<p class="sans-serif">Most warframes can fill multiple roles in a squad depending on how you mod them. However, many of them also have certain tasks that they are most effective at.<br/><br/> For example, Rhino’s abilities allow him to tank effectively, buff teammates, and dps enemies on low levels. Several good frames that can be picked up early on to cover most of the roles are Ember (drops from Saturn) for DPS, Trinity (drops from Ceres) for Healing, Frost for Defence and Crowd Control (drops from Mars), and Rhino (drops from Venus)as a good all-around frame. For more information about frame roles and how to build them, check the #builds or #raid_builds channels.
   </p>
<hr/>   
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Health, Shields, and Armor<</ins></h3>
<p class="sans-serif">(<span style="color:blue">Shields</span>), (<span style="color:red">Health</span>), and (<span style="color:orange">Armor</span>) are the three things that will keep you alive, and the characteristics of each also apply to enemies.

</p> 
<hr/ class="middle-line">
<big><ins><span style="color: blue"</span>Shields</big></ins> are very effective at low levels when enemies don't deal a lot of damage. They provide a regenerating pool of health that must be fully stripped before health takes damage except when shield-bypassing damage is taken into effect.<br/><br/> Shields can be bypassed by toxin damage and slash procs which will deal damage directly to your health. Shields are not affected by armor so they take the full brunt of the damage they receive. <br/><br/>Later in the game, using shields becomes less viable as enemies deal more damage and trigger more shield-bypassing procs, but they are a very useful buff early in the game. Redirection is the strongest mod for boosting shields.<br/><br/> Increasing shield recharge speed are not usually a good way to spend mod capacity on your frame.
</p>
<hr/ class="middle-line">
<big><ins><span style="color:red">Health</span></big></ins> is a non-regenerating pool of health, and once it reaches 0, you will go into a bleed-out state. Health will only take damage if your shields are completely stripped or if you sustain a damage type that will bypass shields.<br/><br/> health is affected by armor, which means that 1 health can actually sustain more damage than 1 shield before being lost.<br/><br/> Health can be regenerated in many ways including Life Strike, Medi-Ray, and certain warframe's abilities, but most of these are not easy to obtain early in the game so improving shields on a low-armor frame may be preferable to increasing health.
</p>
<hr/ class="middle-line">
<big><ins><span style="color:orange">Armor</span></big></ins> provides damage reduction for health, but not shields. <br/><br/>The amount of damage that is reduced is calculated using the formula <big>(armor value)/(armor value + 300),</big> so a frame with 60 armor will negate <strong>16.7%</strong> of damage dealt to its health pool (60 / 360). This allows frames that have high armor values like a Valkyr or an Ice Chroma to sustain massive amounts of damage without dying. Slash procs bypass armor.
</p>
<hr/ class="middle-line">
<hr/>
<p class="sans-serif"><i>It should be noted that shield, health, and armor mods are percentage based; not a flat increase.<br/><br/> Frames like valkyr which have 150 base shield and 600 base armor, as well as a built in method to restore health, should be modded exclusively for health and armor as shields will grant them very little comparative benefit.<br/><br/> Volt has 15 armor, 300 health, and 450 shield. This makes him the perfect candidate to mod for shields rather than health and armor.<br/><br/>
Generally speaking, you will typically mod either for shields, or health and armor. Modding for both takes up slots usually better spent on other mods.
It is highly recommend that when building up your arsenal early on, you stick with either shield frames or health and armor frames as this will allow you to more effectively allocate mod leveling resources.</i></p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="table">#2- Riven Mods</h2>
<p class="sans-serif">
Riven mods are obtained from sorties which require The War Within quest to be completed. This quest is accessed at the end of the Star Chart so don’t worry too much about them early in the game.

</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="table">#3- Weapons</h2>
<h3 class="big-font middle-text"><ins>>Weapon Mods<</ins><h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">Warframe’s modding system allows many useful builds to be created for any weapon, and most weapons can eventually run even the highest level content if they are built properly.
For weapons, the mods that are generally considered "mandatory" are:</p>

<ul>
<p><li><strong>-  Serration and Split Chamber for rifles and bows</strong></p></li>
<p><li><strong>-  Point Blank, Hell's Chamber, and Blaze for shotguns</strong></p></li>
<p><li><strong>-  Hornet Strike, Lethal Torrent, and Barrel Diffusion for secondaries</strong></p></li>
<p><li><strong>-  Pressure Point, Reach, and one of either Berserker or Fury for melee. Additionally, Life Strike is a useful mod but it is difficult to obtain and serves a utility purpose rather than DPS</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p><i>- Some of these mods may take a while to get in game, so don't worry if you can't immediately equip all of these on your weapons. This is a goal to work towards.</i></p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Requirements for Crit/Status Builds<</ins><h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
Most weapons with 20% or higher crit chance are suitable for crit based builds, most weapons with 20% or higher status chance are suitable for a status based build.<br/><br/> Any weapon that does not reach this 20% minimum in either category should be built for flat damage.<br/><br/> With the right mods melee extends down to 15% for crit and shotguns will ideally be at least 30% for status (shotgun status is explained under the “Status” tab). A weapon with both high status and crit chance can be built with mods for both stats to great effect.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Status<</ins><h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
Status is divided into status damage and status chance. When you use a mod like Cryo Rounds, that mod will take the base damage of the weapon and add the shown percentage of damage as cold damage. For example, if your weapon does 5 slash damage, 3 impact, and 2 puncture damage, for a total of 10 damage, a 90% Cryo Rounds will add 9 cold damage to your weapon (10 * 0.9) for a total damage of 19.<br/><br/>
 This damage boost is applied to every shot. If you have a 10% status, chance, then there is a 10% chance for any given bullet to proc a status effect from one of the damage types on the weapon. 
<br/><br/>
The likelihood that a particular status will proc is based on what percentage of the weapon's total damage is of that type. For the above weapon, 52.6% of its total damage is cold, so there is a 10% chance for any proc, and a 52.6% chance that that proc will be cold, leading to a total probability of 5.26% (0.1 * 0.526) chance that any given bullet will result in a cold proc.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Faction Status Weaknesses<</ins><h3>
<p>
<big><ins>As a rule</ins></big>:
<br/><br/>
 <ul>
 <li>impact and magnetic/gas are effective against Corpus, </li>
 <br/><br/>
 <li>puncture and corrosive/blast
 <br/>
 or
 <br/>
 radiation/viral are effective against Grineer, </li>
 <br/><br/>
 <lI>slash and corrosive/blast are effective against the Infested.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
The warframe wiki is an excellent resource for more in-depth information regarding what status types affect different faction types. <br/><br/>
For instance, non-heavy grineer are weak to "corrosive" damage. Dealing corrosive (flat) damage will do bonus damage to those units regardless of the weapon's status chance. In addition to this bonus damage, a corrosive status proc. will strip some of the targets armor, allowing future shots to deal even greater damage. <br/><br/>
The Corpus, as a faction with few armored units, will not feel the effects of the corrosive damage type or corrosive procs, and so a different element such as toxin (health damage) and magnetic (shield damage) should be employed.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Shotgun Status<</ins><h3>
<p class="sans-serif small-font">A populer status combo used my most veterans. can be achieved with shotguns of 30% or higher base status. These shotguns can be efficiently modded for 100% status chance. With any chance below 100%, the status chance is split up between each pellet, and follows the rules listed above dictating which status will proc.<br/><br/>
 A shotgun with 5 pellets, 50% status chance, and 60% of its damage as cold will shoot pellets that each have a 10% status chance, resulting in a 6% chance for any pellet to inflict a cold proc.<br/><br/> 
 -  The quirk with shotguns is that at 100% status chance, each pellet is guaranteed to proc every status on the weapon. A 100% status shotgun built for radiation and viral will CC enemies, deal at least half their health in a shot, potentially killing them, and inflict bleed procs based on the weapon's slash damage which will further chunk the enemy (provided they aren’t killed outright by the initial blast). <br/><br/>
 The shotgun of choice for most veterans when building for 100% stats is the tigris prime (the strun wraith, while not as powerful, can achieve 100% easily-worth noting for low level players).<br/><br/>
 This build is likely out of reach for new players, but worth remembering in case lower MR shotguns with 30+ status are released in the future.

<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Critical Chance Weapons<</ins></h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
For critical weapons, using mods that increase critical chance (Point Strike, Pistol Gambit, Blunderbuss) and critical damage (Vital Sense, Target Cracker, Ravage, Organ Shatter) is very important. The exception is True Steel for melee weapons, because melees have a great deal of mods that build off of critical and melees are fast enough that a 60% increase to critical chance is fairly insignificant.<br/><br/>
 It is important to aim for the head with critical hits because they offer an additional x2 multiplier to damage dealt, further amplifying the effects of a critical hit.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>100% Critical Chance<</ins><h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
Once a weapon hits 100% critical chance, every shot you make becomes a critical hit, and any percentage over 100% translates into a chance for a double critical hit or "orange crit" which multiplies your damage again.<br/><br/> For example(noticing a pattern?), if you have a 112.5% critical chance, there is a 12.5% chance for any shot to be a red crit. If you surpass 200% critical chance,all your attacks become a “red crit” which multiplies your damage by the critical damage yet again. <br/><br/>
This trend continues for every 100% added to critical chance, but after 200%, all critical damage numbers will appear red.<br/><br/> 
*It is worth noting that prior to update 21, surpassing 100% critical chance granted “red crits” as there was no orange marker for critical hits. The system worked exactly the same but all critical hits above 100% were called “red crits.” Don’t be confused if you read old forum/reddit posts about red crits for weapons that can not possibly reach 200% critical chance.
*</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Melee Crits<</ins></h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
Melee weapons interact uniquely with critical hits due to mods like Blood Rush and Berserker. 
</p>

<p class="sans-serif">
Blood rush uses the melee combo counter (which increases as you get more hits in a short amount of time) to multiply the critical chance of your weapon after mods by the damage multiplier of the combo counter and then multiplied again by Blood Rush's modifier (up to 165%).<br/><br/>
 If you have a melee weapon with a 25% critical chance and True Steel (used in this example to demonstrate calculations, not something I would recommend on your build) which increases your critical chance by 60% for a total of 40% critical chance (0.25 * 1.6), with 100 hits on your melee combo counter which translates into a 2.5x damage multiplier, blood rush will provide you with a 165% critical chance (0.4 * 2.5 * 1.65), guaranteeing a critical hit with every hit and providing a 65% chance of an orange crit. 
</p>
<p class="small-font">
Berserker increases your attack speed with every critical hit by 25%, stacking up to 3 times for a total speed boost of +75%. The combination of blood rush and berserker on high critical chance melee weapons (especially ones that can hit multiple enemies per swing and thus increase the combo counter faster) leads to the extreme damage output from weapons like the Atterax.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="table">#4- Leveling Gear<h2>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Affinity<</ins><h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
Your gear is leveled up receving affinity. You gain affinity by killing enemies, completing mission objectives, and completing challenges in a mission (e.g., kill 3 enemies in 10 seconds).<br/><br/>
 Most of your affinity will come from killing enemies. If you kill an enemy, 50% of the affinity from that enemy goes to the weapon you used to kill the enemy, and 50% goes to your warframe. If an ally kills an enemy, the affinity from that enemy is evenly divided between your warframe and each weapon you have in that mission (25% each to your warframe and primary, secondary, and melee weapon if you are fully equipped).<br/><br/>
 A teammate killing an enemy provides the same total amount of affinity as you killing that enemy so “kill-stealing” does not negatively affect your experience. This also means that you can quickly level up a certain piece of equipment by entering a mission with only your warframe and that weapon because then all affinity from teammates will be divided at 50% between your warframe and that weapon.<br/><br/>
 You gain affinity from any enemy killed by an ally within 50 meters of your current position.<br/><br/>
Because of the way affinity works, it is often fastest to level up several pieces of gear at once by entering a mission and allowing your teammates to kill all of the enemies, but you should try to avoid leaching like this unless you have agreed about this with your team before you begin the mission. <strong>Don’t be a dick</strong>.

</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Gear Levels<</ins></h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
Leveling up your weapons from 0-30 does not change the stats on your weapon, but it does allow you to add more mods which will increase the stats on the weapon. <br/><br/>
It is possible to fight enemies at relatively high levels with a low level weapon if it has some mods that greatly increase the damage. or offer an elemental combo that is effective ageinst the faction you are currently fighting.
 
</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>Reactors, Catalysts, and Formas</ins></h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
<span>- <ins>Orokin Reactors</ins></span> (for warframes, archwings, sentinels, and companions) and <span>Orokin Catalysts</span> (for weapons) double the mod capacity for a piece of equipment. This doubling is based on what
 level the gear is, so if an orokin reactor is applied to a rank 10 warframe, that frame will go from 10 mod capacity to 20, and will still reach 60 capacity at rank 30.<br/><br/>
 This increased capacity does not disappear for any reason unless you sell the equipment and rebuild it later, so using a forma does not affect the mod capacity once you relevel the equipment.<br/><br/>
<span>- <ins>Formas</ins></span> are used to reset a piece of equipment to level 0 and add a polarity which will reduce the mod cost of the mod used in that slot by 1/2 if the polarities match, or increase the cost of the mod if the polarities do not match.<br/><br/>
 This is useful for endgame builds for very expensive builds, but generally you can get pretty far into the game without having to forma your gear very many times.<br/><br/>
 A slot in your build can only have one polarity at a time but you can use another forma to repolarize that slot in order to fit a new build (replacing the old polarity with the new one). You can use as many formas as you want on a piece of equipment.

</p>
<hr/ class="middle-line">
 <h2 class="table">#5- Enemy Levels</h2>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">

Enemy levels are not tied to your gear level. Enemy level is simply a stat that shows how much the base health/armor/shields/damage of the enemy will be scaled up.<br/><br/>
 Enemy levels are numerical way to show off how much damage an enemy can take and shell out. In most cases. Just because the enemy is higher leveled then you. That does not mean you can’t take them on. (case in point. Using level 30 gear vs. level 100 enemies in the sorties)

</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="table">#6- Vault Runs</h2>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
- Vault runs allow you to farm for corrupted mods. These mods are very powerful and have both a positive stat and a negative stat.<br/><br/>
 One example is (<ins>Blind Rage,</ins>) which, when maxed, gives you up to +99% power strength in exchange for -66% power efficiency.<br/><br/>
 They are very useful for end game and fine-tuned builds. There are also mods for weapons like Heavy Caliber which provides an increase in weapon damage in exchange for losing accuracy.<br/><br/>
 
Vault runs are accessed through the orokin derelict which requires craftable keys from the market to access (the key blueprints are reusable).<br>
 In all derelict mission except defense or assassinate, a "vault" will spawn somewhere on the map. It has a unique door unlike any other door in the game. and the vault will randomly require <strong>one of four dragon keys</strong> to access. Each dragon key is craftable from a blueprint in the orokin lab in the dojo.<br/><br/>
 To purchase the Dragon Key blueprints, travel to the dojo, when you spawn in, turn 180 degrees and move straight ahead. You will find a room with 3 consoles in the top section. One of those consoles has the key blueprints.<br/><br/>
The Vault in the derelict will randomly require one of the four dragon keys to open it, so you can guarantee that you will find a corrupted mod by entering with a squad of 4 people who each have a different dragon key equipped.<br/><br/>
 Each key provides a significant debuff (speed reduction, damage reduction, health reduction, shield reduction). You can only equip one key at a time and it <strong>must be equipped through the gear wheel in the arsenal</strong> on your liset.

 </p>
 <hr/>
<h2 class="table">#7- Trading<h2>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
Trading in Warframe is performed using the premium currency, platinum. Trading can not be done using solely credits, but credits are required for a trade due to the trade tax. All platinum in the game’s economy comes from people purchasing it, but it is possible to obtain platinum without spending money through the game’s trading system. It is possible to trade any mod, prime part, or many special weapons, among other things. 
</p>
<h3><ins>Terms:</h3></ins>
<ul>
<li>WTB - I want to buy</li>
<li>WTS - I want to sell</li>
<li>WTT - I want to trade my item</li>
<li>WTTF - I want to trade for an item</li>
<li>P - Platinum (premium currency)</li>
<li>PM or PMO - private message me or private message me an offer</li>
<li>NTY - No thank you</li>
<li>Inv - Invite me to the dojo</li>
 </ul><p class="small-font sans-serif">
 It is possible to link an item so that anybody can see it (this is useful for showing the stats on a frame or weapon) by placing [  ] around the name of the item (ex, <span style="color:blue">[Valkyr prime]</span>. This also highlights the item so it draws more attention to your post and makes it easier for people reading trade chat to quickly see what it is that you are trying to buy/sell and then decide if they are interested.
</p>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><a href="http://warframe.market/" target="_blank">Warframe Market</a></h3>
is very helpful website when it comes to cheaking the price for items quickly buying/selling items as people post the price they want and if you are interested, you can quickly message them in game by typing “/w username message” into any chat bar in warframe.<br/><br/>
 It is generally a bad idea to try to haggle with people who post on warframe.market because they have posted the price they expect.<br/><br/>
 In trade chat, haggling a little bit is expected so feel free to lowball an offer a little bit (not too much) or to try to counter offer a price. 

<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Trade Tax<</ins><h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
All trades have a small tax in credits. The base tax is 500 credits per platinum obtained, and there are a series of other set values for bronze, silver, and gold mods, prime parts, etc.<br/><br/>
 (*<i>Important note</i>*)<span style="color:#6666FF">Primed Mods</span> have a trade tax of 1,000,000 credits.<br/><br/>
 In addition to this base trade tax, clans may have a trade tax (generally under 5%) which is added as x% of the default trade tax. Maroo’s Bazaar has an additional tax of 10% on top of the base trade tax so most trades are performed in a dojo to minimize the additional cost. 
</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Performing a Trade<</ins><h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
Trades can be performed either in a clan dojo or at Maroo’s Bazaar.<br/><br/>
Starting a trade in the dojo requires a Trade post to be present. Interacting with it will allow you to start a trade with anyone in the Dojo as long as they still have trades left for the day. the number of trades you have available is based on your Mastery Rank and the daily trades reset at the same time as the daily reset when you obtain your daily reward.<br/><br/>
Maroo’s Bazaar require you to head to said Bazaar on the right side of Earth and both people in the trade must be present in the same instance of the Bazaar. At the bazaar, you must interact with players that have an offer that interests you. You can also set up your own shop from the Gear Wheel.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="middle-text big-font"><ins>>Etiquette<</ins><h3>
<p class="small-font sans-serif">
After you complete a trade, it is good etiquette to thank the other player. It is bad etiquette to try to renegotiate a trade once you have opened the trading screen in the dojo/bazaar unless you are asking if the player has an additional item that you would be interested in purchasing. Even then, it is generally better to try to do this after you have completed a trade unless you are worried about running out of your daily trades.<br/><br/>
 
When you are negotiating a trade, you are not required to make that trade if you and the other person can not agree on the terms of the deal. Feel free to say “no thank you” and try to find someone that is willing to trade on terms you can accept.<br/><br/>

If you receive several messages immediately after posting an ad in trade chat, it may be a good idea to wait several seconds before responding to a message to make sure that you can obtain the best possible offer without being a dick. Send a message to the people that you will not be trading with saying “Sorry, I already bought/sold item x” because nobody likes to be left wondering if their offer will be accepted or not.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="table"><ins>#8- Asking for Help</ins><h2>
<p class="sans-serif">
Feel free to ask for help with missions or quests in clan chat or discord. Our mods and veterans will try to assist you in game, but they may not always be available to help in missions.<br/><br/> Warframe has a great deal of different things to work towards, so even if you are not able to work towards one goal, there is always something else to do. Furthermore, we ask that you limit the amount you ask for help on minor tasks (e.g., farming for plastids). You should only ask for help on missions that prove to be challenging to you or if you are able to contribute to the team.<br/><br/>
 Offering to farm a material such as polymer bundles while you bring a frame such as nekros that contributes to the team is more likely to get you people than asking others to carry you in a farm.
